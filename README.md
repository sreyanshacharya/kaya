# Say Hello to Kaya,

your lifelong companion to keep diabates at bay!

## What is Kaya?

Kaya is meant to be an Agentic System that provides adaptive, non-clinical lifestyle guidance for fitness and health goals, specifically for people with chronic diabetes. It does so by :

1. continuously accepting user habits and feedback
2. revising it's recommended plans over time
3. making safe, constraint-friendly decisions
4. prioritizing consistency of the user over rigid optimization

Note - Kaya does not give medical diagnosis or treatment advice. It strictly operates at a lifestyle-support level.

## What is Kaya Solving?

Lifestyle management for people diagnosed with chronic diabetes is not a one-solution problem. It is a lifelong evolution of daily decisions, fluctuating energy levels, missed workout sessions and changing constraints.
Current systems provide :

1. static excercise plans
2. generic diet advice
3. everyday suggestions that aren't personalised

These systems fail to adapt to the everyday deviations from the plans, which is the normal case for almost everyone. This is where Kaya comes in.

Since Kaya is an Agentic System, it gains an edge over regular ML models and single-turn LLMs as :

1. It's goals are long-term and evolving
2. It is designed to adapt to user behavior that is typically uncertain and noisy
3. It plans adapt based on feedback
4. It always operates under constraints defined by the user
