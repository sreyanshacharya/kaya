      "carbs": "Moderate to high intake (260-270g per day), primarily from complex carbohydrates and high-volume sources. Focus on whole grains (oats, quinoa, brown rice, whole-wheat pasta), starchy vegetables (sweet potatoes, corn, peas), and abundant non-starchy vegetables (leafy greens, broccoli, bell peppers, zucchini) to increase satiety and food quantity without significantly increasing calories.",
      "fats": "Moderate intake (50-60g per day) from healthy, plant-based sources. Prioritize fats from whole foods like avocados (in moderation), chia seeds, flax seeds, and a controlled amount of nuts (e.g., almonds, walnuts). Minimize added oils where possible to manage calorie density while ensuring adequate essential fatty acids.",
      "protein": "High intake (100-110g per day) to support muscle building and satiety. Emphasize diverse vegan protein sources such as legumes (lentils, chickpeas, black beans), tofu, tempeh, edamame, seitan, high-protein grains (quinoa), and potentially a plant-based protein powder to meet daily targets efficiently. This supports muscle repair and growth.",
      "fiber": "Very high intake from a wide variety of plant foods. Focus on consuming large quantities of fruits (especially berries), vegetables (all types), legumes, and whole grains. This significantly contributes to increased food volume and satiety while being low in calories, aiding in belly fat loss and overall digestive health.",
      "other_micronutrients": [
        "Hydration: Drink at least 2.5-3 liters of water per day.",
        "Ensure adequate intake of B12, Vitamin D, and Omega-3 fatty acids (from algae-based sources if necessary), as these can sometimes be challenging to obtain sufficiently on a vegan diet.",
        "Include a diverse range of colorful fruits and vegetables to ensure a broad spectrum of vitamins and minerals."
