Focus on a variety of vegan protein sources such as tofu, tempeh, seitan, lentils, beans, chickpeas, quinoa, edamame, and plant-based protein powders if needed to meet daily targets. This protein level is crucial for muscle preservation and growth during a calorie deficit.",
      "fiber": "High fiber intake, targeting 25-30g per day, primarily from a wide variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes. High fiber contributes to satiety and digestive health.",
